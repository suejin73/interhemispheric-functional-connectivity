# interhemispheric-functional-connectivity
MATLAB codes for calculating direct functional interhemispheric connectivity - fMRI 

The function calculates "direct" interhemispheric connectivity (IC) with instantaneous and lagged options. 
The output IC has been controlled for the effects coming from non-homologous brain regions, therefore it offers the "direct" IC between homologous brain region pairs.
